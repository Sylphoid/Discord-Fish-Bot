# Discord-Fish-Bot

Prototype Fishing Discord Bot README

This is a discord bot that utilizes repl.it in a python environment. In 2019-8-8 it does not have many features besides responding to specific strings. But eventually, it will provide a text-based adventure similar to Tatsumaki's t!fish expereince. As of 2019-8-10 I decided to to start over in Javascript, so this particular bot will no longer be used for projects.
